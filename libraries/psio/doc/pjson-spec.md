# pjson — Schemaless Self-Describing Binary Format

**Status:** v1 (stable). Reference implementation in
`libraries/psio/cpp/include/psio/pjson*.hpp`. This document is the
normative specification.

**Audience:** anyone implementing a pjson parser, encoder, or
interoperable consumer in another language.

---

## 1. Purpose and Position

pjson is a binary serialization format for **schemaless data** —
documents whose structure is not known to the consumer at compile
time. It is the binary peer of JSON: it can losslessly carry any value
JSON's grammar can express, and it can be converted to JSON text and
back. The wire form is approximately the same size as compact JSON
text (~102% on representative API payloads).

The format is designed for:

* **Efficient random-access reads** by name or by index — sub-20 ns
  lookups on cached buffers in practice (see §11 for the algorithm and
  why a hash-prefilter scan outperforms binary-search-of-strings at
  realistic JSON field counts).
* **Single-allocation, single-pass encode** — no DOM tape, no
  intermediate value tree. The encoder appends children forward and
  writes the index at the tail.
* **Persistence and transit** — pjson is a single self-contained byte
  string, suitable for database rows, file storage, RPC payloads, and
  content-addressed hashing.

Compared with:

* **JSON text** — pjson supports random access; JSON text requires a
  re-parse on every read.
* **Postgres `jsonb`** — pjson is publicly specified; `jsonb` is a
  Postgres-internal layout with no third-party readers.
* **MessagePack / CBOR / BSON** — pjson supports indexed lookup by
  hash, where these formats require a linear scan per object.
* **simdjson DOM** — pjson is a persistent byte form that does not
  reference the original JSON text. simdjson DOM cannot exist
  separated from its source buffer.

---

## 2. Conventions

* All multi-byte integers are **little-endian**.
* `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i32`, `i64` denote their usual
  fixed-width unsigned/signed integer types.
* `i128` is a 128-bit signed integer in two's complement.
* Bit positions are MSB = bit 7 within a byte unless otherwise stated.
* Byte ranges are written `[start, end)` (start inclusive, end
  exclusive).
* "Caller" means whatever code provides the buffer to the parser. The
  caller is always responsible for telling the parser the buffer's
  total size; pjson values do not store their own length except where
  noted.

A pjson **value** is a contiguous byte sequence whose total length is
known to the consumer. The first byte is always the **tag**.

---

## 3. Tag Byte

```
bit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
    └─type─┘ └─low─┘
```

The high nibble (`bits 7..4`) is the **type code**. The low nibble
(`bits 3..0`) is **payload-specific** — for some types it carries
encoded data; for others it is reserved.

| code | type          | low nibble use                                 | raw bits after tag |
|------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 0    | `null`        | reserved (must be 0)                           | 0 bytes |
| 1    | `bool`        | the boolean value: 0 = false, 1 = true (others reserved) | 0 bytes |
| 2    | reserved      |                                                | — |
| 3    | `uint_inline` | unsigned value 0..15 (the integer)             | 0 bytes |
| 4    | `int`         | mantissa byte count − 1 (range 1..16)          | `bc` bytes (zigzag-LE) |
| 5    | `decimal`     | mantissa byte count − 1 (range 1..16)          | `bc` mantissa bytes + varscale (1..4 bytes) |
| 6    | `ieee_float`  | reserved (must be 0)                           | 8 bytes (raw IEEE-754 binary64, LE) |
| 7    | reserved      |                                                | — |
| 8    | `string`      | encoding flag (see §4.7); 0..2 valid, others reserved | (size − 1) bytes (length implicit from `size`) |
| 9    | reserved      |                                                | — |
| 10 (A) | `bytes`     | reserved (must be 0)                           | (size − 1) bytes (raw octets) — see §4.8 |
| 11 (B) | `array`     | layout selector — see §5.1: 0 = generic, 1..10 = typed homogeneous (element type code = low_nibble − 1), 11..15 reserved | container body — see §5 |
| 12 (C) | `object`    | layout selector — see §5.2: 0 = single object, 1 = row_array (homogeneous-shape array of objects), 2..15 reserved | container body — see §5 |
| 13–15  | reserved   |                                                | — |

Implementations must reject (return error) on any reserved tag code or
non-zero low-nibble bits in tags that mark them reserved.

---

## 4. Scalar Encodings

### 4.1 `null` (code 0)

Tag byte `0x00` alone. Container `size` is exactly 1 byte.

### 4.2 `bool` (code 1)

Single byte. The low nibble carries the boolean value:

```
0x10  →  false
0x11  →  true
```

Low-nibble values 2..15 are reserved and must cause a parse error.
Container `size` is exactly 1 byte.

### 4.3 `uint_inline` (code 3)

Tag byte alone. The value is the **unsigned** integer encoded in the
low nibble (range `0..15`). Container `size` is exactly 1 byte.

The name reflects the encoding: only non-negative values 0..15 fit
this form. Negative integers and values ≥ 16 use the `int` tag (code
4).

### 4.4 `int` (code 4)

```
tag (1 B): high = 4, low = bc − 1   where bc ∈ {1..16}
mantissa (bc B): zigzag-encoded signed integer, little-endian
```

**Zigzag encoding** maps signed integers to unsigned for compact
representation:

```
zz_encode(v) = (v << 1) ^ (v >> 63)         // for i64
zz_decode(z) = (z >> 1) ^ −(z & 1)          // arithmetic shift
```

For `bc ≤ 8` the value fits `i64`. For `bc ∈ 9..16` the value uses the
full 128-bit range.

Encoders should choose the **smallest `bc`** that exactly represents
the value. Decoders must accept any `bc ∈ 1..16`. There is no
canonical-encoding requirement; both `bc = 2` and `bc = 8` are valid
encodings of the value 200, but encoders should pick `bc = 1`.

The `uint_inline` form (code 3) is preferred over `int` for values
0..15.

### 4.5 `decimal` (code 5)

```
tag (1 B):       high = 5, low = bc − 1   where bc ∈ {1..16}
mantissa (bc B): zigzag-encoded mantissa, little-endian
varscale (1..4 B): scale, see §4.4.1
```

Represents `mantissa × 10^scale` as an exact decimal value.

#### 4.5.1 Varscale — 2-bit-prefix variable-length signed integer

The scale uses a compact variable-length encoding. The first byte's
top 2 bits give the total byte count of the varscale; the remaining
bits hold zigzag-encoded scale data, little-endian.

> **Note: this is NOT the QUIC variable-length integer encoding.**
> QUIC (RFC 9000) uses a 1/2/4/8-byte length ladder (length codes
> map to byte counts 2⁰/2¹/2²/2³). Our encoding uses a 1/2/3/4-byte
> linear ladder. Both share the "top-2-bits-encode-length" idea
> in the first byte, but the length values and per-form capacities
> differ. We chose the linear ladder because pjson's typical values
> (decimal scale, long-key excess) cluster in the 1-3-byte range
> where the linear ladder is more byte-efficient than QUIC's
> power-of-2 jumps.

```
First byte:
   bits 7..6: total byte count − 1   (0 → 1 byte, 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4)
   bits 5..0: low 6 bits of zigzag(scale)

Subsequent bytes (if any): bits 6..(6 + 8·(n-1)) of zigzag(scale).
```

Capacities:

| total bytes | zigzag bits | scale range          |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1           | 6           | −32..31              |
| 2           | 14          | −8 192..8 191        |
| 3           | 22          | −2 097 152..2 097 151 |
| 4           | 30          | −536 870 912..536 870 911 |

Encoders must use the smallest byte count that fits the value.

#### 4.5.2 Decimal vs IEEE float

A floating-point value may be encoded either as `decimal`
(mantissa × 10^scale) or `ieee_float` (raw IEEE-754 binary64). When
both encodings can represent the value exactly:

* If the **decimal form is shorter** in bytes, encoders **should**
  choose `decimal`.
* Otherwise encoders **should** choose `ieee_float`.

Decoders must accept either form for any numeric value.

Round-tripping a JSON number through pjson preserves the **value**,
not the **textual form**. Trailing zeros (`100.00`) and scientific
notation (`1.5e10`) are normalized away.

### 4.6 `ieee_float` (code 6)

```
tag (1 B): high = 6, low = 0
bits (8 B): IEEE-754 binary64, little-endian
```

The 8 bytes are the raw memory representation of the `double`. NaN and
Infinity are technically representable but are forbidden in JSON; pjson
encoders reading from JSON will not produce NaN or Infinity values.
pjson encoders sourced from non-JSON inputs may emit them.

### 4.7 `string` (code 8)

```
tag (1 B): high = 8, low = encoding flag
content (size − 1 B): UTF-8 text; interpretation per the flag
```

The low nibble carries an **encoding flag** that tells the JSON
emitter what to do with the stored text bytes.

| flag | name          | meaning                                                       |
|------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | `raw_text`    | UTF-8 text NOT in JSON-escape form. JSON emit must run a per-character escape pass (handle `"`, `\`, control chars, etc.). |
| 1    | `escape_form` | Text already in JSON-escape form (`\"`, `\n`, `\uXXXX` etc are LITERAL bytes). JSON emit just wraps in surrounding quotes — no per-byte work. |
| 2..15 | reserved     | Implementations must reject.                                  |

The string length is always `size − 1` (no length prefix).

**Encoder choices.** A producer should set the flag according to its
source:

* JSON parser → `escape_form` (the bytes between quotes are taken
  verbatim from the source JSON).
* Typed text value where the producer doesn't know whether escape
  characters are present → `raw_text`.
* Typed text value that the producer has already validated to contain
  no characters needing escape → `escape_form` (cheaper emit later).

Raw binary blobs are NOT a string sub-flag — they have their own
`bytes` tag (§4.8).

### 4.8 `bytes` (code 10)

```
tag (1 B): high = A, low = 0 (reserved)
content (size − 1 B): raw binary bytes
```

The `bytes` tag carries a contiguous run of raw binary octets. There
is no length prefix; the length is `size − 1` from the caller-
provided value `size`. The low nibble is reserved and must be 0;
implementations must reject non-zero values.

**JSON round-trip.** JSON has no native binary literal. JSON emitters
**should** base64-encode the bytes and emit a quoted string. JSON
parsers cannot infer "this string was supposed to be bytes" from the
text alone — convention is to use a key suffix (e.g. `"avatar.b64"`)
so consumers know to base64-decode on input (§7).

**Why a separate tag (not a `string` sub-flag).** Text and binary
are conceptually distinct: text is interpreted as UTF-8 codepoints
and re-encoded for JSON; binary is opaque octets. Carrying them as
separate tags keeps the type discrimination explicit at the wire
layer and removes the binary value from the per-string flag table.

---

## 5. Containers

Containers (`array`, `object`) use a **tail-indexed** layout: child
values are written first, the index is appended at the tail. The
caller-provided `size` of the container is required to locate the
index by walking backward from the end.

The `array` tag (code 11) has **two layout variants** selected by
the low nibble:

* **Generic array** — low nibble = 0. Children may be any pjson
  value. Per-element tags + slot table. See §5.1.
* **Typed homogeneous array** — low nibble = 1..10. Children are
  all the same fixed-width primitive type. No per-element tags,
  no slot table. See §5.1.1.

The remaining low-nibble values (11..15) are reserved.

### 5.1 Generic array layout (tag = 0xB0)

```
[tag: u8 = 0xB0]
[width byte: u8]                 low 2 bits = slot_w_code (0=u8, 1=u16,
                                  2=u24, 3=u32); bits 2..7 reserved (0)
[value_data: variable]
   for each i in 0..N:
      [child value: tag + raw bits]
[slot[N]: N × slot_w bytes]      offset within value_data, LE
[count: u16 LE]                  N — number of children
```

`count` is the **last 2 bytes** of the container.

The encoder picks `slot_w_code` from the actual `value_data` size of
*this* container — independently of any outer container. A small
sub-array inside a 1 MiB document still uses `slot_w = u8` if its own
value_data fits in 256 bytes. This recursion is the highest-leverage
size optimization in pjson: most overhead bytes are slot-table bytes,
and most containers are small.

Each child's byte range within the container is:

```
child_i_start = container_start + 2 + slot[i]    // +2: skip tag + width byte
child_i_end   = container_start + 2 + (i + 1 < N
                                       ? slot[i+1]
                                       : value_data_size)
child_i_size  = child_i_end − child_i_start
```

where `value_data_size = container_size − 2 − slot_w·N − 2`
(subtracting tag, width byte, slot table, and count).

### 5.1.1 Typed homogeneous array layout (tag = 0xB{1..A})

```
[tag: u8 = 0xB{code+1}]              code ∈ {0..9}
[element_0 .. element_{N-1}]         N × element_size raw bytes, LE
[count: u16 LE]                      N — number of elements
```

The wire low-nibble is `code + 1` (so that low_nibble = 0 stays
reserved for the generic-array layout). The element type code is
recovered as `low_nibble − 1`.

Total size: `1 + N × element_size + 2`. Random access reduces to a
single offset computation: `element_i = container_start + 1 + i ×
element_size`. There is no per-element tag and no slot table.

**Element type codes** (low_nibble − 1):

| code | element type | bytes | range / format             |
|------|--------------|-------|----------------------------|
| 0    | `i8`         | 1     | −128..127                  |
| 1    | `i16`        | 2     | −32 768..32 767            |
| 2    | `i32`        | 4     | −2³¹..2³¹−1                |
| 3    | `i64`        | 8     | −2⁶³..2⁶³−1                |
| 4    | `u8`         | 1     | 0..255                     |
| 5    | `u16`        | 2     | 0..65 535                  |
| 6    | `u32`        | 4     | 0..2³²−1                   |
| 7    | `u64`        | 8     | 0..2⁶⁴−1                   |
| 8    | `f32`        | 4     | IEEE-754 binary32          |
| 9    | `f64`        | 8     | IEEE-754 binary64          |
| 10–14 | reserved    | —     | implementations must reject (low_nibble values 11..15) |

Implementations must reject reserved codes.

**When to use vs. generic.** A producer may always encode a
homogeneous primitive array as the generic form instead — the
format does not require typed. The choice is producer-side
**density vs. encoder work**:

| producer                                                | typical choice |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| typed-struct encoder with declared fixed-width array    | typed (zero scan — element type known statically) |
| JSON parser, default mode                               | generic (no homogeneity scan) |
| JSON parser, **strict canonical** mode (§15)            | typed when all elements fit one primitive type, smallest type that fits |
| RPC / DB writer with already-typed columns              | typed |

Wire-size comparison for an `i32[100]`:

| encoding | bytes |
|---|---|
| generic with per-element `int` tags | 1 (tag) + ≤ 5×100 (per-element tag+payload) + 4×100 (slot) + 2 = ~903 |
| typed `i32`                         | 1 + 4×100 + 2 = 403 |

A decoder must accept both forms for any homogeneous primitive
array. Random access is faster on the typed form (constant-stride
pointer arithmetic) than the generic form (slot-table indirect
read), but the time difference is small for small N.

**Encoding rules.**

* Element bytes are little-endian, fixed-width per the element
  type code. Floats use IEEE-754 binary representation as raw
  bytes.
* `count` is `u16 LE` (max 65 535 elements), matching §5.5.
* Element bytes need not be aligned in the wire stream; readers
  must use byte-by-byte copy rather than direct typed loads.

**JSON emission.** A typed array emits to JSON as a JSON array of
numbers. Integer codes (0..7) emit as decimal-integer text; float
codes (8, 9) emit as shortest-round-trippable decimal text. There
is no JSON-side marker indicating the array was stored as typed —
JSON consumers see a plain `[..]` of numbers.

**JSON ingestion.** A JSON parser **may** detect homogeneous
primitive arrays and emit the typed form; a default-mode parser
typically emits generic (simpler, no scan pass). When detection
runs, the parser picks the smallest signed/unsigned/float type
that holds every element exactly. A canonical encoder (§15)
**must** emit the typed form when applicable.

### 5.2 Object layout (code 12)

```
[tag: u8 = 0xC0]
[width byte: u8]                 low 2 bits = slot_w_code (0=u8, 1=u16,
                                  2=u24, 3=u32); bits 2..7 reserved (0)
[value_data: variable]
   for each i in 0..N (in encounter order):
      if slot[i].key_size <  0xFF:
         [key bytes (slot[i].key_size B)][child value]
      else (long-key escape):
         [key_excess: 2-bit-prefix varuint]
         [key bytes (0xFF + key_excess B)][child value]
[hash[N]: N × u8]
[slot[N]: N × (slot_w + 1) bytes]   offset (slot_w bytes LE) + key_size (1 byte)
[count: u16 LE]                  N — number of fields
```

`count` is the **last 2 bytes** of the container.

Each `slot[i]` is `slot_w + 1` bytes:

```
bytes [0 .. slot_w):  offset within value_data (LE)
byte  [slot_w]:       key_size (0..0xFE inline, 0xFF long-key escape)
```

The encoder picks `slot_w_code` per container from this container's
own value_data size. Recursive: a small sub-object inside a large
document uses `slot_w = u8` regardless of the outer document's size.

`hash[i]` is the 8-bit prefilter hash for field `i`'s key (see §5.3).

Each entry's byte range:

```
entry_i_start = container_start + 2 + slot[i].offset    // +2: skip tag + width
entry_i_end   = container_start + 2 + (i + 1 < N
                                       ? slot[i+1].offset
                                       : value_data_size)
```

where `value_data_size = container_size − 2 − (slot_w + 1)·N − N − 2`
(subtracting tag, width byte, slot table, hash table, and count).

Within an entry:

```
if slot[i].key_size != 0xFF:
   key_bytes        = entry[0 ..  slot[i].key_size)
   child_value_starts at entry[slot[i].key_size]

else (long-key):
   varuint excess at entry[0]
   varuint_size = 1..4 (per §4.4.1, but encoding 'unsigned' — see §5.4)
   key_size = 0xFF + excess
   key_bytes = entry[varuint_size .. varuint_size + key_size)
   child_value_starts at entry[varuint_size + key_size]
```

Field encounter order is preserved (no canonical sort).

### 5.2.1 Row-array layout (tag = 0xC1)

A **row_array** is a homogeneous-shape array of objects: every record
has the same K keys in the same order. The shared schema (key bytes
+ key prefilter hashes) lives **once** at the array level instead of
being repeated in every record. This is the dominant case for
JSON-over-API payloads (lists of records, query results, log lines)
and removes substantial per-element overhead.

```
[tag: u8 = 0xC1]
[width byte: bit 0..1 = slot_w, bit 2..3 = recoff_w, bits 4..7 reserved (must be 0)]
                width code: 0 = u8, 1 = u16, 2 = u24, 3 = u32
[K: 2-bit-prefix varuint (number of fields per record)]
[shared key slots: K × u32 LE]      packed { key_offset:24, key_size:8 }
                                     (offsets into the keys area)
[hash[K]: K × u8]                    shared 8-bit prefilter hashes
[shared keys area: contiguous key bytes, length = sum of key_sizes]
[records body: variable]
   for each i in 0..N:
      [value_data_i]                contiguous value bytes
      [slot_i[K]: K × slot_w bytes] per-record value offsets
                                     (relative to value_data_i start)
[record_offsets[N]: N × recoff_w bytes]   start of record i
                                           (relative to records-body start)
[count: u16 LE]                      N — number of records
```

`count` is the **last 2 bytes** of the container, matching §5.1 / §5.2.

#### 5.2.1.1 Adaptive widths

The encoder picks `slot_w`, `recoff_w` to fit the largest value in
each width-scaled field, packing them into the single width byte:

| width code | bytes | max value |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 255 |
| 1 | 2 | 65 535 |
| 2 | 3 | 16 777 215 |
| 3 | 4 | 4 294 967 295 |

`slot_w` scales with the **largest single record's body size** (since
slot offsets are relative to record start). `recoff_w` scales with
the **total records-body size** (since record offsets are relative
to the records-body start).

For a 1000-record array of small objects (each ≤ 256 B, total body
< 64 KB): `slot_w = u8`, `recoff_w = u16` — minimal overhead. For
arrays beyond 16 MB body: `recoff_w = u32`.

The shared key slots use a fixed `u32` width (24-bit offset + 8-bit
size, matching the §5.2 single-object slot format) — keys areas are
always small (≤ a few KB), so adaptive width here adds complexity
without measurable benefit.

#### 5.2.1.2 Per-record body

Each record carries its own slot table at the **tail** of its body:

```
record_i_size = (i + 1 < N
                 ? record_offsets[i+1]
                 : records_body_size) − record_offsets[i]

slot_i_pos    = record_i_start + record_i_size − K × slot_w
value_data_i  = record_i_start[0 .. slot_i_pos)
```

Slot `slot_i[j]` is the offset (within record i's value_data) where
field j's value begins. Field j's value extends to the next slot's
offset (or to `slot_i_pos` for the last field).

#### 5.2.1.3 Lookup `arr[i][key]`

```
1. Read N from the last 2 bytes; compute records-body extents.
2. Read width byte → (slot_w, recoff_w).
3. record_i_start = records_body_start + record_offsets[i].
4. Hash-prefilter the SHARED hash[K] for `key_hash8(key)`. On hit,
   verify the candidate via the shared keys area → field index j.
5. Read slot_i[j] from record i's tail.
6. Value bytes live at record_i_start[slot_i[j] .. slot_i[j+1] or
   record_i_size − K·slot_w).
```

The hash-prefilter scan happens **once per array**, not once per
record — this is the primary lookup-perf win over generic `t_object`
× N elements.

#### 5.2.1.4 Wire savings vs. generic

For an array of N records with K fields each, fixed key bytes
totalling Kb bytes of keys, and fixed value sizes totalling Vb
bytes of values:

| layout | bytes (excl. constant overhead) |
|---|---|
| generic `array` of `object` | N × (1 + Kb + K + 4K + 2 + Vb) + 4N + 3 |
| `row_array` | 4K + K + Kb + N × (Vb + K·slot_w) + N·recoff_w + 4 |

The savings are `N × (1 + Kb + K + 2 + 4K − K·slot_w) − 4N + ...`,
dominated by removing per-record key bytes (`N × Kb`) and per-record
hash table (`N × K`). For typical small records the row_array form
is 30–50% smaller.

#### 5.2.1.5 Encoder rule

A producer **may** emit row_array when every JSON object in a source
array has:
- the same number of keys K,
- the same K keys (byte-equal) in the same order,
- byte-equal hash-array (derivable from keys),

When the encoder detects this on a single homogeneity-detect pass,
it emits row_array; otherwise it falls back to generic
`t_array` × `t_object`. The detection cost is one pass over the
JSON array's first object's key list, then byte-compares against
each subsequent object's first K key bytes.

Strict canonical encoders (§15) **must** emit row_array when
applicable.

### 5.3 Key prefilter hash

Each object's `hash[i]` byte is the **low 8 bits of XXH3-64** computed
over the field's key with any **trailing `.tag` suffix stripped**.

```
key_hash8(k):
   strip k from the last '.' onward (if any)   // "amount.decimal" → "amount"
   return XXH3_64(stripped) & 0xFF
```

Suffix stripping enables presentation-tag-suffix matching: a stored key
`"amount.decimal"` and a query key `"amount"` hash to the same byte,
allowing a fast prefilter to find candidates regardless of suffix
attachment. A full byte-equality compare on the matching slot
distinguishes them.

Decoders **must** verify the stored hash byte matches `key_hash8` of
the stored key bytes; mismatch is an error.

#### Collision behavior

The hash is 8 bits — there are 256 possible values. For an object of
N fields with random keys, the expected number of hash collisions per
query is ≈ N/256. Typical JSON objects have N ≤ 30, so the average
lookup hits one hash candidate, runs one byte-equal-string-compare,
and returns. For very wide objects (N ≈ 256) you'd expect ~1 false
positive per query — still cheap.

The lookup algorithm (§11) handles collisions correctly: on a hash
hit that fails the byte-equal key check, it advances and re-scans
the remainder. So worst-case N collisions degrade lookup to O(N) of
**string compares** rather than just O(N) of byte compares. For
N ≤ 1000 this remains acceptable (microseconds, not milliseconds).

**Adversarial / hash-flooding inputs.** An attacker who controls the
JSON keys can construct N keys that all hash to the same byte (only
~256 attempts to find one collision; finding N colliders by birthday
attack is `O(N · √256) = O(16N)` work for the attacker — trivial
preprocessing). This degrades a single lookup to N string compares.
For pjson's intended use cases (database storage of API request
payloads, internal RPC, configuration files) JSON keys are typically
**schema-defined by the application**, not attacker-controlled, so
this attack vector is rare.

If keys ARE attacker-controlled in your deployment (e.g., a generic
key-value store storing user dictionaries), an implementation may:

* Switch to a **seeded** hash. XXH3-64 takes a 64-bit seed; pick a
  random seed at process startup and use it for every `key_hash8`
  computation. Attackers can no longer precompute colliders.
  Producers and consumers in the same process share the seed; if
  pjson values are persisted across processes (database, file)
  the seed must also be persisted alongside the value or recomputed
  per-doc.
* Cap the max fields per container at the application layer below
  pjson's 65535 hard limit, bounding worst-case lookup work.
* Skip hash verification on read (see §9 errors) and rely solely on
  byte-equal key compare. Drops to O(N) per lookup unconditionally
  but eliminates the hash-flood asymmetry; ~3-5× slower for typical
  workloads.

The reference C++ implementation does **not** seed the hash —
`key_hash8` is deterministic, which makes content-addressable
hashing (two pjson buffers from the same logical input hash to the
same content-id) work cleanly. This is the right tradeoff when
keys are not attacker-controlled. Deployments that need both
deterministic hashing AND attacker-resistance should canonicalize
inputs at a higher layer (e.g., reject objects with > K fields, or
hash the key set externally).

### 5.4 Long-key escape

If a key's byte length is ≥ 255, the slot's `key_size` byte is set to
`0xFF` and the actual key length is encoded inline in the entry's
value_data region as a 2-bit-prefix **unsigned** varuint (same
encoding as §4.4.1 minus the zigzag step) for the **excess**:

```
actual_key_length = 0xFF + varuint_excess_value
```

The varuint is read forward starting at the entry's first byte. After
it, the key bytes start, then the value bytes.

Capacities (varuint of `excess`):

| varuint bytes | excess range | actual key length |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0..63 | 255..318 |
| 2 | 0..16 383 | 255..16 638 |
| 3 | 0..2²² − 1 | up to ≈ 4 M + 255 |
| 4 | 0..2³⁰ − 1 | up to ≈ 1 G + 255 |

In practice, JSON keys are short identifiers; the long-key escape is
defensive. Encoders should assume keys < 255 chars in the common path.

### 5.5 `count` width

The count field is a fixed `u16 LE` (2 bytes), supporting up to 65 535
fields per container. Implementations **must** reject containers with
counts beyond this on the wire. (For deeper limits, see §8 — pjson is
not designed for million-field containers.)

### 5.6 Offset width and container size limit

The `offset` field within each `slot` is **24 bits**, bounding any
single container's `value_data` region to **16 MiB**. Documents larger
than this must split into multiple top-level containers.

---

## 6. Document — top-level

A pjson document **is** a single value. There is no envelope, magic
number, or version marker. The format defines no document framing of
its own; consumers know they are reading pjson because their
application protocol said so (HTTP `Content-Type`, file extension,
database column type, etc.).

A consumer parses a pjson document by being given a `(ptr, size)` pair
of bytes. The first byte is the tag, and the value occupies all `size`
bytes.

If multi-document framing is needed at the application layer, a simple
prefix scheme works:

```
[size: 2-bit-prefix varuint][document bytes]    repeated
```

This framing is application-defined and not part of pjson.

---

## 7. JSON Round-trip

### 7.1 Value-preserving, not byte-preserving

JSON ↔ pjson round-trips preserve **values**, not source-text
byte-for-byte. Specifically:

* Whitespace and indentation are not preserved (compact emit only).
* Trailing zeros in decimals are normalized (`100.00` → `100`).
* Scientific notation may be normalized (`1.5e10` → `15000000000`).
* Field encounter order **is** preserved.

For applications requiring byte-identical round-trip (e.g., signature
verification on the exact source JSON), pjson is insufficient — use a
canonical-JSON form on both sides, or keep the original text alongside
the pjson.

### 7.2 Type mappings

| JSON | pjson tag |
|---|---|
| `null` | 0 (null) |
| `false` | 1 (bool, low nibble = 0) |
| `true` | 1 (bool, low nibble = 1) |
| integer fitting `i64` | 3 (uint_inline) for 0..15, else 4 (int) |
| integer beyond `i64` | 4 (int) with bc 9..16 |
| fractional / exponent | 5 (decimal) when shortest, else 6 (ieee_float) |
| `"..."` | 8 (string) — bytes between quotes, escape-form preserved |
| `[ ... ]` (heterogeneous) | 11 (array, low nibble = 0 — generic) |
| `[ ... ]` (homogeneous primitive, canonical mode) | 11 (array, low nibble = code+1 — typed) |
| `{ ... }` | 12 (object) |

There is no JSON literal for `bytes`. JSON encoders may emit them as
base64-encoded strings under a key-suffix convention:

```
// JSON form
{"avatar.b64": "iVBORw0KGgo..."}

// pjson form
object with key "avatar" (suffix stripped on lookup hash) whose value
is a `bytes` tag holding the base64-decoded raw bytes.
```

This convention is established at the application layer; pjson stores
the bytes raw regardless of how they were textually represented.

### 7.3 Unrepresentable JSON values

JSON forbids `NaN`, `+Infinity`, `−Infinity`. pjson encoders sourcing
from JSON will not emit these. Decoders converting pjson to JSON must
reject them or signal an error.

### 7.4 Suffix vocabulary (recommended)

| suffix | meaning | typical pjson tag |
|---|---|---|
| `.b64` | base64-encoded binary | bytes (10) |
| `.hex` | lowercase hex string | bytes (10) |
| `.base58` | base58 string | bytes (10) |
| `.decimal` | decimal-digit string | int (4) or decimal (5) |
| `.rfc3339` | RFC 3339 timestamp | int (4) — nanoseconds since epoch |
| `.unix_ms` | milliseconds since Unix epoch | int (4) |
| `.unix_us` | microseconds since Unix epoch | int (4) |

The suffix is purely a JSON-side hint: pjson stores the binary form;
the consumer reattaches the suffix when emitting JSON. The hash byte
strips the suffix so `view["amount"]` and a stored key
`"amount.decimal"` land in the same hash bucket.

---

## 8. Limits

| limit | value |
|---|---|
| max fields per container | 65 535 (`u16` count) |
| max value_data bytes per container | 16 777 215 (24-bit offset) |
| max key length | unbounded via long-key escape (§5.4); short-key path covers 0..254 bytes |
| max integer mantissa | 128-bit signed (16-byte zigzag) |
| max decimal scale | ±536 870 911 (4-byte varscale) |
| max nesting depth | implementation-defined; suggested cap: 256 |

---

## 9. Errors

A parser must detect and reject:

* Tag with reserved type code (2, 7, 9, 13–15).
* Tag with reserved low-nibble bits (e.g., `bool` low nibble > 1;
  `string` low nibble > 1; `array` low nibble 11..15; `bytes` low
  nibble != 0).
* `int` or `decimal` with bc < 1 or bc > 16.
* Container with stated count yielding `slot_table_pos < 1` or
  `value_data_size > size − overhead`.
* `slot[i].offset` ≥ `value_data_size`, or `slot[i].offset` ≥
  `slot[i+1].offset` (children must be ordered, no overlap).
* `hash[i] != key_hash8(stored_key_bytes_for_i)`.
* `varscale` or long-key varuint with claimed length exceeding the
  remaining buffer.
* Invalid UTF-8 in a string (parser may opt to reject; the spec does
  not mandate UTF-8 validation, but consumers needing it should
  validate).

### 11.1 Why this is fast

Object key lookup is **O(N) per level**, where N is the field count of
the one object being searched. In the asymptotic sense binary search
on sorted keys would be O(log N), but in practice the hash-prefilter
linear scan beats it at every realistic JSON field count:

* The prefilter scans N **single bytes** sequentially. Implementations
  use SWAR (8 bytes per cycle, branchless) or SIMD intrinsics. For an
  object of 25 fields the entire scan touches one cache line.
* On a hash hit (rare; ~1/256 false-positive rate per byte), one
  string compare. For typical-sized identifier keys this is also a
  single cache-line read.
* No sorted-key data structure → no dependent-load chain, no branchy
  tree traversal.

A balanced binary-search-of-strings at the same N pays log₂(N)
**string** compares, each with a data-dependent branch and pointer
chase to a non-adjacent node — all cache-unfriendly. The reference
implementation measures ~17 ns per object lookup on a 25-field object;
a comparable tree-of-strings implementation lands in the 50–100 ns
range. The asymptotic crossover where a sorted/tree-based structure
would actually win is thousands of fields per object — far beyond
what JSON documents contain in practice.

The format trades the asymptotic optimality of log(N) for cache-
locality optimality at small-to-medium N, which is where every
realistic JSON object lives.

                            offset = out.position − (start + 1),
                            key_size = min(|key|, 0xFF)))
            if |key| ≥ 0xFF:
               append varuint(|key| − 0xFF)
            append key bytes
            encode_value(child, out)
         for r in records:
            append r.hash as u8
         for r in records:
            append slot_pack(r.offset, r.key_size) as u32 LE
         append count = |fields| as u16 LE
```

The encoder is **single-pass forward-write**. No memmove, no
header reservation, no backpatching beyond writing the index at the
tail.

## 13. Versioning

This is **pjson v1**. Future revisions of the format will:

* Allocate previously-reserved tag codes (2, 7, 9, 13–15) for new types.
* Allocate previously-reserved low-nibble bits as flags or extensions
  (e.g. new `string` flags, new typed-array element codes in
  `array`'s 11..15 reserved range).
* Be detectable through application-layer means (file headers, MIME
  types, RPC protocol versions). The pjson value format itself does
  not carry a version byte.

A v1 parser encountering a v2 wire (e.g., a value with tag `0xD0`)
must reject the buffer rather than guess.

---

## 14. Conformance Tests

A conforming implementation must round-trip the following corpus
byte-for-byte through encode → decode → encode:

* All primitive values: `null`, `true`, `false`, integers covering each
  byte_count from 1 to 16, decimals with each varscale tier (1, 2, 3,
  4 bytes), all eight-byte IEEE doubles including 0.0, 1.0, NaN
  (encoded only — JSON forbids), small / medium / large strings, raw
  byte blobs of varying sizes, empty arrays, empty objects.
* Random nested structures up to depth 8 with mixed types.
* Object key collision on the hash byte (multiple fields share the
  same hash byte; lookup must return the right one for each).
* Long-key escape: object with a key of 254 bytes (no escape) and a
  key of 255 bytes (escape).
* Typed homogeneous arrays for each element code (i8, i16, i32, i64,
  u8, u16, u32, u64, f32, f64), including empty (N=0) and non-empty
  forms.

A reference test corpus lives at `libraries/psio/cpp/tests/pjson_tests.cpp`.

## 15. Canonical Encoding

The pjson format permits multiple wire encodings of the same logical
value (e.g. a small integer can use `uint_inline` or `int`). For
content-addressable hashing, signature verification, deduplication,
and equality comparison via byte-compare, implementations need to
agree on a single canonical form for every value.

### 15.1 Encoding rule (priority order)

A canonical encoder selects the encoding by applying these rules in
order:

1. **Round-trip JSON without precision loss.** Choose only encodings
   that preserve the value's information through a JSON-text →
   pjson → JSON-text round-trip. (Strings preserve their escape form
   per §4.7; numbers preserve their value bit-exactly per the rules
   below.)
2. **Smallest possible byte size.** Among encodings that satisfy
   rule 1, choose the encoding that produces the fewest bytes.
3. **Fastest decode on ties.** When two encodings produce the same
   byte count AND both preserve precision, choose the one that
   decodes fastest. For numbers this means: prefer `ieee_float` over
   `decimal` (a raw 8-byte load is cheaper than mantissa-and-scale
   reconstruction).

This makes the canonical encoding **deterministic per value** —
given the same logical value, every conforming encoder produces the
same bytes for that value. (Field encounter order is excluded; see
§15.4.)

### 15.2 Numbers — concrete rules

For an integer value `v`:

| value range                          | canonical encoding              |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0 ≤ v ≤ 15                           | `uint_inline` (1 byte)          |
| v < 0 or v > 15, fits i64            | `int` with smallest bc (1..8)   |
| beyond i64, fits i128                | `int` with smallest bc (9..16)  |

For an integer-valued double (e.g. `42.0`): treat as integer and
apply the table above. The fractional part is zero, so it round-trips
through any integer encoding losslessly.

For a fractional double `d` (non-zero fractional part):

1. Compute the **shortest round-trip decimal** `(mantissa, scale)`
   such that `from_double(d)` produces this pair (Ryu / Grisu /
   Dragon4-equivalent). Trim trailing zeros from the mantissa
   (incrementing `scale`) until either the last digit is non-zero
   or `scale = 0`.
2. Let `decimal_size = 1 + mantissa_bc + varscale_size(scale)`.
3. If `decimal_size < 9` → encode as `decimal`.
4. Else if `decimal_size > 9` → encode as `ieee_float`.
5. Else (tie at 9 bytes) → encode as `ieee_float` (faster decode).

For a fractional with no representable shortest decimal (e.g.
NaN, ±Inf — JSON-illegal but a non-JSON producer could emit them):
encode as `ieee_float`.

For a `(mantissa, scale)` pair supplied directly by a typed numeric
source (not derived from a double): encode the `(mantissa, scale)`
form regardless of whether `ieee_float` would be shorter — the
typed value is **already** a `decimal` semantically; collapsing to
double would lose its exact-decimal identity. Producers that want
the smallest encoding regardless of identity should convert through
double first and apply the rules above.

### 15.3 Strings

The wire form of a string carries an encoding flag (§4.7) that
**identifies the source** rather than canonicalizing it:

- A string from a JSON text source encodes as `escape_form` —
  byte-identical to the source bytes between the JSON quotes.
- A string from a typed text value encodes as `raw_text` — the
  program-visible text, with no escape pass.
- Raw binary uses the separate `bytes` tag (§4.8), not a string
  flag.

Two pjson values for the same logical text "Hello world" — one
from JSON, one from a typed string — will NOT be byte-equal
because they deliberately preserve their different source
representations. This is the format's **byte-equality means same
source** property.

For applications that want logical equality across sources, decode
both as their text form and compare the unescaped bytes (which
requires applying JSON unescape rules to an `escape_form` value).
Or canonicalize at a higher layer before encoding.

### 15.4 Containers

- **Field encounter order is application-defined**, not canonical.
  Two pjson objects with the same fields in different orders are NOT
  byte-equal, even if their data is logically the same. Applications
  that need order-independent equality must canonicalize key order
  at a higher layer (typically: sort keys lexicographically before
  encoding).
- **Slot offsets** must be ascending and exactly cover the
  value_data region (no gaps, no overlap). The encoder's natural
  forward-write produces this; non-canonical layouts (e.g. jumbled
  slot offsets reordering the children) are valid pjson but not
  canonical.
- **Hash bytes** are deterministic from key bytes (low byte of
  XXH3-64 over suffix-stripped key per §5.3). Always canonical.
- **num_fields** is the actual N. Always canonical.

### 15.5 Objects — generic vs. row_array

For an array whose elements are all objects with **identical
schemas** (same K keys, same order, byte-equal key strings), the
canonical encoder **must** emit the **row_array** form (§5.2.1)
rather than a generic `t_array` of N `t_object`s. The shared
schema removes the per-record overhead, so the row_array form is
always the smaller-byte choice — no further size comparison needed.

A canonical encoder must also pick the **smallest adaptive widths**
(`slot_w`, `recoff_w`) that fit the actual record body sizes:

```
slot_w   = smallest width fitting max(record_body_size_i) for i in 0..N
recoff_w = smallest width fitting total records-body size
```

Mismatched objects (extra fields, missing fields, different
byte-order of keys) make the array non-homogeneous; canonical
encoders fall back to generic `t_array` of `t_object`s in that case.

### 15.6 Arrays — generic vs. typed

For an array whose elements are all of one fixed-width primitive
type (signed integer, unsigned integer, float), the canonical
encoder **must** emit the **typed** form (§5.1.1) using the
**smallest element-type code** that holds every element exactly:

1. If any element is fractional (non-zero fractional part): use the
   smallest IEEE float that round-trips every element. `f32` if
   every element round-trips through a 32-bit float, else `f64`.
2. Else if every element is non-negative: use the smallest unsigned
   width that fits every element: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, or `u64`.
3. Else: use the smallest signed width that fits every element:
   `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, or `i64`.

For an array with at least one non-primitive element (string,
container, mixed type), or whose primitive elements span multiple
unrelated families (mixed integer-and-float, mixed signed-and-very-
large-unsigned beyond `i64`), the canonical encoder uses the
**generic** form (§5.1).

Rationale: the typed form satisfies §15.1 priority rule 2
(smallest size) for homogeneous primitive arrays; the size win is
substantial (often 2× or more on dense arrays) and is the only
pjson encoding choice that gives byte-different output for the
"same" logical array. Strict-canonical encoders therefore must
choose typed when applicable.

### 15.7 Strict canonical (byte-equality contract)

A pjson value is **strictly canonical** iff:

- Every nested numeric value satisfies §15.2.
- Every nested string carries the canonical flag for its source
  (§15.3).
- Every nested container has slots in ascending offset order with
  no gaps (§15.4).
- Every nested array satisfies §15.6 (typed form when homogeneous
  primitive, with the smallest element-type code that holds every
  element exactly).
- Every nested array of homogeneously-shaped objects satisfies
  §15.5 (row_array form with smallest adaptive widths).
- Field order matches the application's chosen canonicalization
  policy (which itself must be deterministic from the logical
  value — typically lexicographic key sort, or original input
  order if input order is part of the logical identity).

Two strictly-canonical pjson buffers are byte-equal iff their
logical values are equal under the application's order policy.

### 15.8 Producer guidance

Implementations marketed as "canonical pjson encoders" must:

- Apply §15.1 priority rules for every value.
- Document their field-order policy (lex-sort, source-order, etc.)
  so consumers can match.
- Never emit reserved low-nibble flag values (§3) on canonical
  output.

The reference C++ encoder follows §15.2 rules for numbers and
preserves source-order field encoding. It does NOT sort keys; that's
left to a higher layer.

## Appendix A. Glossary

| term | meaning |
|---|---|
| **value_data** | the contiguous bytes between the container's tag byte and its tail index, holding all child values (and inline keys, for objects). |
| **slot** | a packed `u32` per child holding `{ offset (24 bits), key_size (8 bits) }`. The high byte is the key length for objects, unused (must be 0) for arrays. |
| **slot table** | the array of N slots at the tail of a generic container. Per-slot stride = `slot_w` for arrays, `slot_w + 1` for objects (offset + key_size). slot_w is encoded in the width byte at byte 1 of the container. |
| **width byte** | byte 1 of every generic-array (`0xB0`) and generic-object (`0xC0`) container. Low 2 bits encode `slot_w_code` (0=u8 .. 3=u32); high 6 bits reserved. Picked per container from value_data size; recursive. |
| **hash table** | the array of N hash bytes (objects only), located immediately before the slot table. |
| **count** | the `u16 LE` at the last 2 bytes of every container, giving N. |
| **canonical layout** | for an object, `hash[i] == key_hash8(field_i_name)` in declaration order matches a producer's expected order, enabling byte-equal fast-path validation against a precomputed hash array. |
| **suffix stripping** | the hash function ignores any trailing `.<suffix>` on the key, supporting presentation-tag conventions. |

## Appendix B. Worked Example

Compact JSON `{"a":1,"b":"two"}` (17 bytes) encodes as **20 bytes** of pjson:

```
0xC0                       tag: object
                           ── value_data (10 bytes) ──
0x61                       'a' (key for entry 0; key_size in slot)
0x31                       int_inline 1 (entry 0 value)
0x62                       'b' (key for entry 1)
0x80                       string tag (entry 1 value tag)
0x74 0x77 0x6F             't', 'w', 'o' (string content)
                           ── hash[2] (2 bytes) ──
0xH1                       low byte of XXH3_64("a")
0xH2                       low byte of XXH3_64("b")
                           ── slot[2] (8 bytes) ──
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01        slot[0]: offset=0, key_size=1
0x02 0x00 0x00 0x01        slot[1]: offset=2, key_size=1
                           ── count (2 bytes) ──
0x02 0x00                  N = 2
```

Reading this back from an arbitrary `(ptr, size = 20)`:

```
N      = read_u16_le(ptr + 18) = 2
slot_table = ptr + 18 − 8 = ptr + 10
hash_table = ptr + 10 − 2 = ptr + 8
value_data_start = ptr + 1
value_data_size  = 8 − 1 = 7
```

Field `"a"`:
* hash[0] at `ptr[8]`, slot[0] at `ptr[10..14]` → offset 0, key_size 1.
* entry at `ptr+1`, key bytes `ptr[1..2)` = `'a'`.
* value at `ptr+2`, size = (slot[1].offset − slot[0].offset) − 1 = 1 byte.
* `parse_value(ptr+2, 1)` → tag `0x31` → int_inline = 1.

Field `"b"`:
* hash[1] at `ptr[9]`, slot[1] at `ptr[14..18]` → offset 2, key_size 1.
* entry at `ptr+3`, key bytes `ptr[3..4)` = `'b'`.
* value at `ptr+4`, size = value_data_size − slot[1].offset − 1 = 4 bytes.
* `parse_value(ptr+4, 4)` → tag `0x80` → string with content `"two"`.

End of spec.
